# Predicting The Likelihood Of E-Signing A Loan. Based on Financial History

<p>Lending companies work by analyzing the financial history of their loan applicants, and choosing wheather or not the applicant is too risky to be given a loan. If the applicant is not, the company then determines the terms of the loan. To acquire these applicants, companies can organically receive them through their websites/apps, often with the help of advertisement campaigns. Other times, lending companies partner with peer-to-peer (P2P) lending marketplaces, in order to aquire leads of possible applicants. Some example market place include Upstart, Lending Tree and Lending Club. In this project, we are going to asses the 'quality' of the leads our company receives from the marketplaces.</p><br>

    **Market:** The target audience is the set of loan applicants who reached out through an intermediary marketplace.
    **Product:** A loan.
    **Goal:** Develop an model to predict for quality applicants. In this case study, quality applicants are those who reach a key part of the loan application process.

<p>In this case study we will be working for a fintech company that specializes on loans. It offers low APR loans to applicants based on their financial habits, as almost all lending companies do. This company has partnered with a P2P lending marketplace that provides real-time leads (loan applicants). The numbers of conversions from these leads are satisfactory.
    The company tasks you with creating a model that predicts whether or not these leads will complete the electronic signature phase of the loan applicants. The comapny seeks to leverage this model to identify less quality applicants and experiment with giving them different onbording screens.</p>
