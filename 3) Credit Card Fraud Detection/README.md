# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Throughout the financial sector, machine learning algorithms are being developed to detect fraudulent transactions. In this project, that is exactly what i have tried. Using a dataset of of nearly 28,500 credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised and supervised anomaly detection algorithms, i have tried to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud. This project contains:
   * Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
   * Isolation Forest Algorithm

Furthermore, using metrics suchs as precision, recall, and F1-scores etc.. and more
