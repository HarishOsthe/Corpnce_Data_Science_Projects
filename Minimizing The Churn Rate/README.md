# MINIMIZING CHURN OF SUBSCRIPTION PRODUCT THROUGH ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL HABITS

Subscriptiton products often are the main source of revenue for companies across all industries. These products can come in the form of a "one size fits" overcompassing subscription, or in multi-level memberships. Regardless of how they structure their memberships, or what industry they are in, comapnies almost try to minimize customer churn (a.k.a. subscription cancellations). To retain their customers, these companies first need to identify behavioral patterns that act as catalyst in disengagement with the product.

**Market:** The target audience is the entirety of a company's subscription base. they are the ones comapnies want to keep

**Product:** The subscription product that customers are already enrolled in can provide value that users may not have imagined, or that they may have forgetten.

**Goal:** The objective of this model is to predict which users are likely to churn, so that the comapny can focus on re-engaging these users with the product. These efforts can be email reminders about the benefits of the product, especially focusing on features that are new or that the user has shown to value.
